    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to follow best practices for security, scalability, and debuggability, focusing on Authorization Independence and clear data ownership.  The core strategy is to leverage path-based ownership for user-specific data and to avoid `get()` calls in security rules by denormalizing authorization context when needed.\n\n*   **Users Collection:** No user data is stored outside of Firebase Authentication. User identity (UID) from `request.auth.uid` is used as the anchor for all user-owned data.\n*   **Hierarchical Data:** The structure reflects the relationships between entities.  For example, `ApplicationWindows` are stored as subcollections of `Applications` which are under `users`. Similarly, `Files` are stored as subcollections under `Directories`, forming a filesystem-like hierarchy.\n*   **Authorization Independence:** Path-based ownership (`/users/{userId}/...`) inherently provides authorization independence. Security rules can easily validate `request.auth.uid == userId` without needing to read any data. No denormalization is needed here.\n*   **QAPs:** Path-based ownership ensures secure `list` operations. Rules can limit list access to the currently authenticated user's data. The principle of Structural Segregation (Homogeneous Security Posture) also supports QAPs by ensuring that each collection has clear and consistent security needs.\n"
